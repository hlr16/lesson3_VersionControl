            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Version control is a system that aids programmers in keeping a file up to date even if multiple programmers are working on the file. Version control systems are also helpful because they allow people to recall specific versions of the file and compare.  They are also very helpful in keeping a file or a set of files organized and in one place. Using a distributed version control system is very helpful for keeping files in one organized place with clear versions of one project and all the files in the project. Git, the version control system being used stores the history of the project allowing previous code to be viewed by the programmer.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Git Introduced</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git is one of the most popular distributed version control system used. Git stores files and changes linked to it and tracks as well as saves changes made to a project or file. Git has many benefits especially its seamless ability to allow collaboration by keeping the most updated version of a file as well as tracking changes made to the file it then merges changes made so the version is the most updated. Git has many features including branching. Branching allows programmers to separate tasks so the branch that is done can be implemented and not have to wait for the other branch of code to be finished.  </p>

                <span class="text-muted">Git Stages</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git is a complex system, but it can be broken down to three stages of file editing. It has three different essential stages knows as the committed, modified and staged a file can be in any of the three stages. When a file is committed the data is safely stored in the local database of the machine. When a file is modified that means changes have been made but it is not committed to the database yet. Lastly, when a file is staged is an in between committed and modified stages. Staged means the file has been modified and will be committed in the next commit demand. </p>

                <span class="text-muted">Git Repositories</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git repositories keep track of the program over time. When a program is initialized with git a .git/ folder is created. Here is where git tracks and stores all changes and versions committed to the database. It is important not to delete this as this is where the history is stored for versions to be pulled and pushed. Before one starts a program, a repository must be created and initialized to the code editing software being used. Once it is initialized and committed the repository begins tracking and saving versions of the file. The repository keeps all history and versions of files in a project.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Git Commands</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git commands are used within a program to aid git in the storing process. The most basic purpose of the commands are to add, commit, and push. Before these commands can be used, initializing git (git init) is the first command used after creating a repository. git init connects your machine to the git directory. A helpful command is git status. Git status allows the editor to see if the directory is error free. Once you want a file in the staging area of git one must run git add. Git add puts the file in staging awaiting the next command, git commit. Git commit takes the added files and commits the changes into the local version control. Once a version is pushed (git push) takes the code from the local source to the git cloud which can now be accessed from anywhere. </p>
